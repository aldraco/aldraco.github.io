    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Methodical software engineer, with experience working remotely with realtime and batch analytics data. I strive to build things that are reliable and easy to maintain, but also relish opportunities to jump headfirst into new projects and learn new
      things. I've worked remotely since 2013, and strongly believe that remote work and distributed teams are the future.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<span><a href=https://parse.ly>https://parse.ly</a></span> 
<h4>Backend Software Engineer<span class="u-pull-right">2017 current</span></h4>
<span class='technologies'> Python  Swift  JavaScript  Redis  Elasticsearch  Spark  Storm  Kafka  AWS </span>

<p>Parse.ly is an analytics company, focused on measuring web attention. We measure over 65 billion (with a &#39;b&#39;) events each month. Being on such a small and tight-knit team, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to work on almost every part of our infrastructure, both adding new features and enhancing stability.</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>Implement solutions for scaling issues, bugs, reducing costs, and other maintenance items</li>
  
  <li>Shipped new features for core products, and help prototype new products</li>
  
  <li>Mentored other engineers/developers</li>
  
  <li>Refactored code and built developer tools to empower our small team to work faster</li>
  
</ul>

<h4>Success Engineer<span class="u-pull-right">2015 2017</span></h4>
<span class='technologies'> Python  JavaScript  Django  SQL  AWS </span>

<p>Success Engineers bridge the gap between customers and code. Communication and debugging skills are useful to assist customers with their integrations with our product, as well as connecting the business and engineering teams within the company.</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>Prototyped internal customer usage data tools to predict and prevent churn; successfully advocated for usage data&#39;s place in our workflow</li>
  
  <li>Managed technical aspects of customer relationships, including: data discrepancy analysis, custom integration support, answering technical questions in sales/customer calls, debugging</li>
  
  <li>Built and scripted internal tools to streamline repetitive internal tasks and save time</li>
  
</ul>
 
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>Self<img class="thumbnail" src=></h3>
<span><a href=></a></span> 
<h4>Amanda Jones website<span class="u-pull-right">Summer &#39;15  </span></h4>
<span class='technologies'></span>

<p>Amanda Jones, a country singer, needed a basic website to get her started on her career. I used Facebook&#39;s API to give her an easy-to-manage Event list, and built a simple media player and Wordpress integration. (She has since signed with a label, and her online presence is now run through a music management company -- major congrats, Amanda!)</p>
<ul>
  
</ul>

<h4>East Brookfield Church Website<span class="u-pull-right">Winter &#39;15   </span></h4>
<span class='technologies'> HTML  CSS  JavaScript  Angular  Wordpress </span>

<p>The church needed a simple website for service times and directions. I focused on making the page load quickly (Vermont&#39;s cellular data coverage is not great) and a clean, simple design to focus on the content.</p>
<ul>
  
</ul>
 
   
  
              <h2>Open Source/Community Projects</h2>
              <a href=http://github.com/exercism/cli><img src=/GitHub-Mark-64px.png
                       class='bubblehead u-pull-right'></a>
              <h4>Exercism: Contributor and Mentor</h4>
              <span class="technologies">Python Graphite Statsd </span>
              <p>Exercism, an open-sourced, community-driven learning platform, is a great place to learn a new coding language. I&#39;ve contributed to the CLI tool that downloads and uploads code problems, and occasionally help mentor solutions.</p>

              <h4>Logu: Batch Uploader for Graphite</h4>
              <span class="technologies">Python Graphite Statsd </span>
              <p>Logu is a tool that uploads historical log data with Graphite, which is more commonly used as a realtime system. Bulk uploads aren&#39;t directly supported in popular client libraries like statsd, so I wrote a tool to make that easier.</p>
