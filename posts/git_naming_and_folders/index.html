			<h1>Git Folder Structure and Naming Conventions</h1>

				<p>Recently at work, I ran into one of those once-in-a-while git issues that generally end up being solved with creative Googling and git magic. This time, though, I wanted to understand a little more about how git works.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>I was developing a new feature with a colleague, so we had two branches going that we were rebasing against each other as we went.</p>
<pre><code>feature-name/my-branch
feature-name/his-branch
</code></pre><p>At some point, we decided it was time to merge our branches into one consolidated effort. At the time, it made sense to me to name the new branch simply <code>feature-name</code>. I attempted to deploy this branch but git on the target machine started throwing errors, saying that</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; error: 'refs/remotes/origin/feature-name/my-branch' exists; cannot create 'refs/remotes/origin/feature-name'
&gt;&gt;&gt; error: some local refs could not be updated; try running git remote prune origin' to remove any old, conflicting branches
</code></pre><p>Fortunately, git tells you the solution.</p>
<h3 id="solutions">Solution(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li>run <code>git prune</code> if you can</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have permission to run git while ssh'ed on the target server. I did, however, have permission to edit files, which is where learning a little more about how git works came in handy.</p>
<p>on server:</p>
<ul>
<li>find <code>$PROJECT_DIR/.git/refs/old-branch-name</code> and delete it</li>
<li>find <code>$PROJECT_DIR/.git/refs/packed-refs</code>, delete any references here to the old (short name) branch</li>
</ul>
<p>locally:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git checkout -b new branch name</code> <strong>which has the same number of path segments as the branch name with the most segments</strong> (more below)</li>
<li>try deploying/checking out the new branch</li>
</ul>
<p>All you're doing is manually scrubbing references to the offending branch, instead of having <code>git prune</code> do it for you.</p>
<p>The real &ldquo;magic&rdquo; behind git turns out to simply be git commit hashes. Each one references a snapshot of your working directory at any given time. A commit history is a series of snapshots, and references to a HEAD of a branch or a remote, for example, is really just a reference to a git commit hash.</p>
<p>Try it yourself and see that running the following shows the last commit hash in your master branch. Start at your project directory's root:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
</code></pre><p>Now, if you run this instead while the master branch is checked out, you'll see a reference to the file above:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat .git/HEAD
</code></pre><p>Each branch, remote, or tag is just a point in time in the project's history, and can be described using git hashes. References, or refs, to these hashes are organized in the <code>.git</code> folder by branch name.</p>
<h3 id="preventative-measures">Preventative measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>give branch names within a project the same depth of path segments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The root of the issue was the <strong>depth</strong> of my branch name. Git lets you name branches like files - including backslashes. Logical conventions for a project with several active branches might be:</p>
<pre><code>fix/feature-being-fixed
feature/new-feature-name
hotfix/thing-that-broke
</code></pre><p>What this means is that if you have created a file already at <code>$PROJECT/.git/refs/heads/feature/my-branch</code>, then <code>feature</code> is now a folder. Since you can’t create a file at a location that is already a folder, trying to create a new branch named feature results in an attempt to create a file at <code>$PROJECT/.git/refs/heads/feature</code> — but that’s already a directory. Oops!</p>
<p>If you’re set on using the /feature/ path segment, you can always name it <code>feature/main</code> or <code>feature/github_username</code> instead.</p>
<p>What is <strong>packed-refs</strong>? The packed-refs file acts somewhat like a super directory, and allows for saving space in some large projects. (In my case, deleting the regular ref wasn't enough since git also looks here.)</p>
<p>Run <code>git pack-refs --all</code> to create this file, which will delete the default ref files in favor of this super-reference. Subsequent ref updates are stored normally, meaning branches that aren't updated often don't need to take up space. This can be handy on a project with many contributors, branches, or tags/versions.

<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>
