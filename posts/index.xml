      <description>I often get emails from new developers who are looking to transition into tech, but not quite sure where or how to get started. It is a challenge that I have also faced myself - I also started learning to code several years ago, feeling overwhelmed with all of the options, and having little to no context to help choose between them. Should I do a bootcamp? Which bootcamp should I do?</description>

      <title>Using Hugo Structured Data to Build a Resume Page</title>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how I built my Resume page using Hugo&amp;rsquo;s data directory functionality.
I have enjoyed using Hugo to set up a blog. I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly enjoy design and layout, so a system that allows me to do that one time, while still outputting an cheap-to-host static site, is nice to work with.
I wanted to set up a resume page, and give myself more control over the design than I would have using Markdown/CSS &amp;ndash; treating the resume as a collection of data, instead of a piece of content, provided that flexibility.</description>

      <title>Git Rebase Tricks: Rebase Interactive</title>

      <description>I have been using the git rebase command heavily lately, and thought it might be good to write a quick tips and tricks guide about it. I have found it incredibly useful for keeping my git history clean, organizing my thoughts about what I am writing and why, and grouping changes together as logical groups.
Why would I want to use this? First, it might be useful to motivate why this tool is helpful.</description>

      <description>Recently at work, I ran into one of those once-in-a-while git issues that generally end up being solved with creative Googling and git magic. This time, though, I wanted to understand a little more about how git works.
The problem I was developing a new feature with a colleague, so we had two branches going that we were rebasing against each other as we went.
feature-name/my-branch feature-name/his-branch At some point, we decided it was time to merge our branches into one consolidated effort.</description>
