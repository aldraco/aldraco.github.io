			<h1>Handing Code off between machines</h1>
			<time>20.10.2020 16:24</time>
			<div>
				<p>I recently upgrade my work machine to a brand-spanking new ThinkPad, which I love. However, I&rsquo;m still working out all of the details of switching &ndash; I did not have a good dotfile setup (which I am now rectifying). Little things, like remembering the hacky ways I had set up credentials to various services, or convenience environment variables that I forgot weren&rsquo;t actually built into the OS ($ASHLEY_PERSONAL_PROJECTS should be, imho).</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m still switching between two laptops, and am much too lazy to dedicate the time to just finishing the process, I&rsquo;m running into situations where most of what I need to do works on the new laptop, but I run into a snag I can&rsquo;t fix immediately. Most recently, I had a branch of a project running with some debug code that I wanted to run against some data in S3. Unfortunately, I had not set up the AWS permissions properly, and so decided to run the job on my old laptop.</p>
<p>To get the code to the old location, I pushed it up to github and then fetched it back down again, which worked fine (also, Slack works really well as a cross-environment clipboard for terminal commands!).</p>
<p>I was laughing about this situation with my coworker, and he mentioned that it was possible to just send the code directly from one laptop to the other. I recalled reading that you can set up your own workstation as a remote, and thought it might be worth looking into that for the next ~few months~ few days until I&rsquo;m finally set up in the new work environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>You have some debugging code, or perhaps a private repo that you&rsquo;d like to get onto another machine, but don&rsquo;t want to push it to github just yet. How do you get that code from one machine to the other, directly?</p>
